 What is TCL?
TCL (Transaction Control Language) commands manage transactions in a database.
A transaction is a group of operations that are executed as a single unit to ensure data consistency. TCL commands help commit, rollback, or temporarily save data during a transaction.

1. COMMIT
Purpose: To permanently save all changes made during the current transaction.
Example:
INSERT INTO Students VALUES (3, 'Neha', 22, 'neha@mail.com');
COMMIT;
Output:
> START TRANSACTION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
> INSERT INTO Students VALUES (3, 'Neha', 22, 'neha@mail.com');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
> COMMIT;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
> SELECT * FROM Students;
+----+--------+-----+------------------+
| ID | Name   | Age | Email            |
+----+--------+-----+------------------+
|  1 | Raj    |  20 | raj37@gmail.com  |
|  2 | Priya  |  21 | priya@mail.com   |
|  3 | Neha   |  22 | neha@mail.com    |
+----+--------+-----+------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

2. ROLLBACK
Purpose: To undo changes made in the current transaction (before COMMIT).
Example:
DELETE FROM Students WHERE ID = 2;
ROLLBACK;
Output:
> START TRANSACTION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
> DELETE FROM Students WHERE ID = 2;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
> ROLLBACK;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
> SELECT * FROM Students;

|  2 | Priya  |  21 | priya@mail.com   |
