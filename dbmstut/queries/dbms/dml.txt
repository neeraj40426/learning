What is DML?
DML (Data Manipulation Language) includes SQL commands used to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data in a database.
**DML commands manipulate data inside database tables â€” not the structure of the tables.

1. INSERT
Purpose: To add new records (rows) into a table.
Example:
INSERT INTO Students (ID, Name, Age, Email)
VALUES (1, 'Raj', 19, 'raj37@gmail.com');
Output:
> SELECT * FROM Students;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
> INSERT INTO Students (ID, Name, Age, Email)
  VALUES (1, 'Raj', 19, 'raj37@gmail.com');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)
> SELECT * FROM Students;
+----+------+-----+-------------------+
| ID | Name | Age | Email             |
+----+------+-----+-------------------+
|  1 | Raj  |  19 | raj37@gmail.com   |
+----+------+-----+-------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)


2. UPDATE
Purpose: To modify existing records in a table.
Example:
UPDATE Students SET Age = 20 WHERE ID = 1;
Output:
> SELECT * FROM Students;
+----+------+-----+-------------------+
| ID | Name | Age | Email             |
+----+------+-----+-------------------+
|  1 | Raj  |  19 | raj37@gmail.com   |
+----+------+-----+-------------------+
> UPDATE Students SET Age = 20 WHERE ID = 1;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
> SELECT * FROM Students;
+----+------+-----+-------------------+
| ID | Name | Age | Email             |
+----+------+-----+-------------------+
|  1 | Raj  |  20 | raj37@gmail.com   |
+----+------+-----+-------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

3. DELETE
Purpose: To remove specific rows from a table.
Example:
DELETE FROM Students
WHERE ID = 1;
Output:
> SELECT * FROM Students;
+----+------+-----+-------------------+
| ID | Name | Age | Email             |
+----+------+-----+-------------------+
|  1 | Raj  |  20 | raj37@gmail.com   |
+----+------+-----+-------------------+
> DELETE FROM Students WHERE ID = 1;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
> SELECT * FROM Students;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
